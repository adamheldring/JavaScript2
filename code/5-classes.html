  // Objects allow you to store data and functions. Unlike arrays,
  // they are not ordered, and so do not use indexes at all for
  // retrieving or modifying their values. Instead they use keys and values
  // to store pointers to data.
  //
  // Have a read through the documentation here before you begin: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp
  // The documentation mentions methods, which is where you assign a
  // function to a key in the object. We'll be focusing entirely on the more simple
  // version it mentioned; properties.

  // Task 1: Below is a variable called person which has an object assigned to it.
  // The object has one property with the key (studentAt) which has a string "Technigo" as its
  // value. Add two more properties (keys and values) to the object; one called name which
  // should store your name as a string, and one called age which should store
  // your age as a number.



//STRETCH GOAL - USING CLASS TO CREATE INSTANCE OF Person

  class Person {
    constructor(studentAt, name, age) {
      this.studentAt = studentAt,
      this.name = name,
      this.age = age
    }
    printInfo() {
      console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}`)
    }
  }

  const mrHeldring =  new Person("Technigo", "Adam", 36)

  console.log(mrHeldring)

//STRETCH GOAL - ADDED METHOD TO CLASS TO PRINT INFO ABOUT Person INSTANCE
  mrHeldring.printInfo()



  // Task 2: Add a fourth property to the object using the key `favoriteFoods`. Its value
  // should be an array of strings with some foods you like.

  mrHeldring.favoriteFoods = ["burgers", "tartar", "carbonara"]
  // console.log(mrHeldring)

  // Task 3: Use the dot notation to print the name and age properties from the person
  // object using console.log.

  // console.log(mrHeldring.name + " is a person that is " + mrHeldring.age + " years old")

  // Task 4: You can add a property to an object using the dot notation and using assignment to
  // set a its value. Do this to add a new property to the person object with the key `eyeColor`
  // and value being a string with the color of your eyes.

  mrHeldring.eyeColor = "Brown"
  // console.log(mrHeldring.eyeColor)

  // Task 5: Objects can be nested within other objects. To fetch a value, you must chain
  // the dot notation. For example, you could select the entire `adult` object from the
  // `dog` object below using the notation `dog.labrador.adult`. Using the dog object below,
  // use console.log() to print the name of the puppy (so it should print "Buster").



//STRETCH GOAL - USING CLASS TO CREATE TWO SEPARATE INSTANCES OF Dog

  class Dog {
    constructor(breed, lifeStage, name) {
      this.breed = breed
      this.lifeStage = lifeStage
      this.name = name
    }
  }

  const adultDog = new Dog("labrador", "adult", "Marley" )
  const puppyDog = new Dog("labrador", "puppy", "Buster")

  console.log(adultDog)
  console.log(puppyDog)

  console.log(puppyDog.name)
